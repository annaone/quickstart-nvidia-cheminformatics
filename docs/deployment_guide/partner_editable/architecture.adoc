image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans specified number of (defaults to 2) Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** An autoscaling group with GPU instances (defaults to p3.2xlarge).
** Cheminformatics and Megamolbart services and ECS tasks.
* An ECS Cluster to run the tasks.
* An ALB to load balance the traffic.
* A CloudMap namespace for service discovery.
* An EFS file system to share data between tasks.
* CloudWatch Container Insights for metrics and logging.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
