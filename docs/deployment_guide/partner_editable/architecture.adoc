image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/nvidia-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones (defaults to two).* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** An Auto Scaling group with GPU instances (defaults to p3.2xlarge).
** Cheminformatics and Megamolbart services and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks.
* An Application Load Balancer to load balance the traffic.
* An Amazon ECS cluster to run the tasks.
* An Amazon Cloud Map namespace for service discovery.
* Amazon ECS CloudWatch Container Insights for metrics and logging.
* An Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system to share data between tasks.
