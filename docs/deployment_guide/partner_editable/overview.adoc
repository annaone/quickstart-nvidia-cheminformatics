This Quick Start deploys {partner-product-name} on the AWS Cloud. It's designed for chemists and health care scientists who want to explore MegaMolBART, a transformer model of the latent space of small molecules obtained through self-supervised learning of compound SMILES. After deployment, you can access a user interface for analyzing analogues around and between compounds. 

This Quick Start can serve as a proof of concept for big pharmaceutical and start-up companies that are curious about representational learning for compounds or generative chemistry before implementing {partner-product-short-name} in their own environments.
